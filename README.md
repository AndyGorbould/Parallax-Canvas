# Parallax-Canvas

1. Make a canvas with the forest assets
2. Get it to infinite scroll
3. Listen for mouse up/down for perspective change
4. Listen for scrollwheel for zoom




Notes:
'context.createPattern' doesn't seem to work in this case.
Log x value to see where the update/repeat is going wrong!
draw() - x+x+x+x position is janky, find solution
